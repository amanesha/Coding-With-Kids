- we will cover 3 different scenarios
1. linking to external places on the web.
2. linking from one document to another 
   withing the project.
3. linking to a specific spot on a document inside
   the project

Options
=======

Arduino
-------

Project Bloks (in development)
--------------------------------
Project Blocks is on the web at https://projectblocks.withgoogle.com/    and is a new project
from Google that is still being developed but looks
pretty awesome. if ou have younger kids that want
to learn logic and flow.

- to link to other document we go to index.rst and to 
link to specific postion

There are lots of great options for
where to start,
and  :doc:`/Options/justlogic` is a great
place to start. Note that the 
:doc:`best starting point </Options/justlogic>`  is another way to refer
to the same place but give you link text some title

for detial about the hardware and code question
see :ref:`Options sectionf for <_hwcodeOptions>`
